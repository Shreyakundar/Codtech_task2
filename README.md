Overview of the project: 
Project: Temparature converter

Objective: 
The objective of this C++ project is to create a temperature converter application that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin using a console-based interface.

Key Activities:
1.Displaying a menu for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin conversions.
2.Implementing conversion formulas for each temperature scale.
3.Handling user input and ensuring error-free operation.
4.Providing a clear and interactive console interface for repeated conversions.

Technologies used :
1.C++ Programming Language: Primary language for implementing the application logic.
2.Standard Library (iostream, iomanip): Used for input/output operations and formatting.
3.System Commands (system): Utilized to clear the console screen for a cleaner interface during operation.
